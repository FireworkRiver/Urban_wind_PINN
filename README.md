# Urban_wind_PINN

In this project, a Physics-informed neural network (PINN) model is proposed for predicting the steady state wind field of a single building under different scenarios. The model processes data grouping as dimensionless numbers between 0 and 1 to allow it to be applied to multiple scenarios simultaneously. After being trained with a small amount of CFD simulation data based on a real building model, the PINN model is able to generate a 3D steady state wind field under any wind direction and wind force.
